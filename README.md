# CSharpFileJoiner
A simple component to join multiple source code files into one with some flexibility. Meant for coding competition sites such as CodinGame.com and similar.

## What is it for?
- A simple source code file joiner which joins in a "smart" way several source files into a single one.
- Meant for online coding challenges where a single file can become unmanageable and if you are like me and like to keep code properly organized.
- Meant for C# but built so it can be extended to other languages if needed with some ease.

## features
These are the initial features supported:
 1. Organization of using clauses.
 1. Optional namespace.
 1. Supports of nested directories, if you like to organize your code even more.
